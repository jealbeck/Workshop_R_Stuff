## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Inflammation Trial Report
Our findings demonstrate there is moderate effectiveness on our pink unicorn medication is now being recommended to patients worldwide!!!
```{r inflammation, echo=FALSE}
analyze <- function(filename, output=NULL){
  #Generate plots from a data input over different
  #numeric analyses from the given input file
  
  if (!is.null(output)){
    pdf(output)
  }
  
  dat <- read.csv(file = filename, header = FALSE)
  #Min
  min_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, min)
  plot(min_day_inflammation)
  #Max
  max_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, max)
  plot(max_day_inflammation)
  #Mean
  avg_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, mean)
  plot(avg_day_inflammation)
  if (!is.null(output)){
    dev.off()
  }
}
analyze("data/inflammation-01.csv")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
